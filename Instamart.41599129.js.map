Natural carbs are whole-food sources of carbohydrates, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains that have not been processed or refined. These healthy carbs provide essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that can help reduce inflammation, boost the immune system, and lower the risk of chronic diseases. On the other hand, processed carbs are usually stripped of most of their nutrients and added with sugar, salt, and/or preservatives. These types of carbs are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels. Examples of processed carbs include white bread, pastries, sugary cereals, cookies, and chips. It’s best to avoid these types of carbs if you want to stay healthy. The bottom line is that when it comes to healthy carbs, natural sources should always be prioritized over processed versions. Eating a variety of nutrient-dense whole foods is the key to nourishing your body and promoting optimal health.\"}\r\n  isVisible={visibleSection === \"diet\"}\r\n  setIsVisible={setIsVisibleSection}\r\n  name = 'diet'\r\n />\r\n  </>\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Instamart","import uparrow from '../asset/up-arrow.png'\r\nimport downarrow from '../asset/down-arrow.png'\r\n\r\nconst Accordian = ({ description, title, isVisible, setIsVisible, name }) => {\r\n console.log(isVisible, \"accordianisVisible\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"menu-item-card\">\r\n        <span>\r\n        <div style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\", fontSize: \"24px\" }}>{title}</div>\r\n        {isVisible && <div style={{fontWeight:'500'}}>{description}</div>}\r\n      </span>\r\n        <button\r\n          onClick={(e) => {\r\n            setIsVisible(e.target.name);\r\n            console.log(e,\"clickk\")\r\n          }}\r\n          name={isVisible ? \"\" : name}\r\n          style={{\r\n            borderRadius: \"5px\",\r\n            padding: \"10px\",\r\n            marginLeft: \"10px\",\r\n            border: \"1px solid grey\",\r\n            height:\"50px\"\r\n          }}\r\n        >\r\n          {isVisible ? \"Hide\" : \"Show\"}\r\n        </button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Accordian;\r\n","module.exports = new __parcel__URL__(require('./helpers/bundle-manifest').resolve(\"89fa4\")).toString();","module.exports = new __parcel__URL__(require('./helpers/bundle-manifest').resolve(\"8KJ30\")).toString();"],"names":["$ayMG0","parcelRequire","$9d85df0fc830cd5a$export$2e2bcd8739ae039","isVisible","setIsVisible","useState","visibleSection","setIsVisibleSection","jsxs","Fragment","jsx","$05bJn","default","title","description","name","$00f991464001bae1$export$2e2bcd8739ae039","console","log","className","style","fontWeight","fontSize","onClick","e","target","borderRadius","padding","marginLeft","border","height","module","exports","URL","resolve","import","meta","url","toString"],"version":3,"file":"Instamart.41599129.js.map"}
